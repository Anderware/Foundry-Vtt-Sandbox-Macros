# Single Activation for cItem Group
With this modification, any cItem Group that ends with _/_SingleActivation_ will automatically make sure that only one cItem can be Activated at a time.

If you dont mind some minor modification of sandbox core files, this can be done quite easily.

## As always
* Make a backup of any Sandbox file you edit __**before**__ any editing
* Any changes you have made to Sandbox core files will be overwritten when updating Sandbox to a newer version so save your edits somewhere to re-apply them again 

## Version Compability
This modification has been tested with the following versions
Sandbox  | FoundryVTT
-------  | ----------
0.8.7    | 0.7.9
